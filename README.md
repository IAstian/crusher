Self destruct mechanism for a system with folders and files in it

Do you want to renew your folders and files, 

Example if that's your fetching mechanism, You can apply the above function,

Which is just a pair of loops and a few file system functions.

Then the fetching page will readd the folders back to the wanted directory.

Don't use it for other reasons tho  ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,

Its not cool.
